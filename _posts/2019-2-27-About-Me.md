I'm a musician and a software developer from SC, now in Nashville. For a couple years I built web apps and experiments with large language models at Ally Bank. In 2024 I quit to spend more time on other projects in music and technology. Trying to make music/software/stuff that helps us live better

This is a playlist of some of my favorite artists right now: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1k5HVkPuzVcRiZ6vc3PSNw?si=339aacba52e34fa2)

Current interests:
- making music: [Winyah](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4iyP4VOGOLzbt2Vxcyu6zG?si=RWa7SB67TlSiDo3o38pZkg)
- building a better stage plot designer for artists: [Stage Plot Designer](https://stage-plot-designer.vercel.app)
