## Call of the Wild
### *Winner of Best UI/UX Award at CUHackit 2021*
[Devpost Link](https://devpost.com/software/call-of-nature)

Pandemic induced depression is at an all-time high. Call of the Wild seeks to use gamification principles to encourage users to participate in daily outdoor activities. The app accomplishes this by picking a location in a radius around the user as a goal to walk to. After reaching the target the daily streak increases by one, incentivizing daily activity.

I collaboratively designed and developed the front-end with Figma and React Native (JavaScript), and led the development timeline & chose critical features for final product.
