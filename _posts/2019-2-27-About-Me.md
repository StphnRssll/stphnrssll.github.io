title: About me
---
I'm a musician and a software developer from SC, now in Nashville. For a couple years I built web apps and experiments with large language models at Ally Bank. In 2024 I quit to spend more time on other projects in music and technology. Interested in creating music/software/stuff that helps people in some way. And being good to the people around me. And getting skills and resources that make me better at doing those first two things.

This is a playlist of some of my favorite artists right now: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1k5HVkPuzVcRiZ6vc3PSNw?si=339aacba52e34fa2)

Current interests:
- making music: (Winyah)[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4iyP4VOGOLzbt2Vxcyu6zG?si=RWa7SB67TlSiDo3o38pZkg)
- building a better stage plot designer for artists: https://stage-plot-designer.vercel.app
- smoothies / protein shakes for lunch
- Bartosz Ciechanowski's interactive sound explainer https://ciechanow.ski/sound/
- trying to understand electricity and electronics, esp in relation to audio hardware
- trying to get better at DIY repairs for music gear and household stuff
