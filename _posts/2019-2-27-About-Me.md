I'm a musician and a software developer from SC, now in Nashville. For a couple years I built web apps and experiments with large language models at Ally Bank. In 2024 I quit to spend more time on other projects in music and technology. Aiming to make music/software/stuff that I like and others get something out of.

Current interests:
- making music: [Winyah](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4iyP4VOGOLzbt2Vxcyu6zG?si=RWa7SB67TlSiDo3o38pZkg)
- building a better stage plot designer for artists & tour managers: [Stage Plot Designer](https://stage-plot-designer.vercel.app)
- making playlists (like this one, [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1k5HVkPuzVcRiZ6vc3PSNw?si=339aacba52e34fa2))
- trying to understand electricity and electronics, esp in relation to audio hardware
- trying to get better at DIY repairs for music gear and household stuff
- protein smoothies for lunch
- Bartosz Ciechanowski's interactive sound explainer: [ciechanow.ski/sound](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/)
- Nicky Case's Nutshells [https://ncase.me/nutshell/](https://ncase.me/nutshell/)
